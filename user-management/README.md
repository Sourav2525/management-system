## User Management 
This architecture promotes modularity, scalability, and maintainability by separating concerns and enabling independent development and deployment of backend services. Additionally, it facilitates seamless integration with the frontend, allowing users to interact with HR management functionalities in a unified manner.

### Frontend
A unified frontend interface interacts with backend microservices via API calls. It presents a cohesive user experience for managing users, roles, and departments.

### Backend
Comprised of separate microservices (user-service, role-service, department-service) responsible for specific domains. Each service encapsulates its business logic, data storage, and API endpoints.

#### 1. User Management Service (Backend Name: user-service):
- **Responsibility:** Responsible for managing user-related operations.
- **Database:** Includes tables such as users, user_roles, user_departments, etc., to store user information, role assignments, department associations, etc.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `/api/users`: CRUD operations for managing users.
  - `/api/roles`: Endpoints to assign roles to users.
  - `/api/users`: CRUD operations for managing users.

#### 2. Role Management Service (Backend Name: role-service):
- **Responsibility:** Handles role-related operations.
- **Database:** Contains tables like roles, role_permissions, etc., to store role definitions and associated permissions.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `/api/roles`: CRUD operations for managing roles.
  - `/api/permissions`: Endpoints to define and manage permissions.
  - `/api/role-assignments`: Endpoints to assign roles to users.

#### 3. Department Management Service (Backend Name: department-service)::
- **Responsibility:** Manages department-related operations.
- **Database:** Includes tables such as departments, department_employees, etc., to store department information and employee associations.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `/api/departments`: CRUD operations for managing departments.
  - `/api/employees`: Endpoints to assign employees to departments.
  - `/api/department-details`: Endpoints to retrieve department details and employee listings.
