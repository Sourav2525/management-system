## User Management 
This architecture promotes modularity, scalability, and maintainability by separating concerns and enabling independent development and deployment of backend services. Additionally, it facilitates seamless integration with the frontend, allowing users to interact with HR management functionalities in a unified manner.

### Frontend
A unified frontend interface interacts with backend microservices via API calls. It presents a cohesive user experience for managing users, roles, and departments.

### Backend
Comprised of separate microservices (user-service, role-service, department-service) responsible for specific domains. Each service encapsulates its business logic, data storage, and API endpoints.

### Microservice 1: User Management Service (Backend Name: user-service):
- **Responsibility:** Responsible for managing user-related operations.
- **Database:** Includes tables such as users, user_roles, user_departments, etc., to store user information, role assignments, department associations, etc.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /users`: Retrieve a list of all users.
  - `GET /users/{id}`: Retrieve details of a specific user.
  - `POST /users`: Create a new user.
  - `PUT /users/{id}`: Update an existing user.
  - `DELETE /users/{id}`: Delete a user.
- **Documentation**:
  - Handles CRUD operations for users.
  - Manages user authentication and authorization.
  - Users can be assigned roles to determine their permissions within the system.

### Microservice 2: Role Management Service (Backend Name: role-service):
- **Responsibility:** Handles role-related operations.
- **Database:** Contains tables like roles, role_permissions, etc., to store role definitions and associated permissions.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /roles`: Retrieve a list of all roles.
  - `GET /roles/{id}`: Retrieve details of a specific role.
  - `POST /roles`: Create a new role.
  - `PUT /roles/{id}`: Update an existing role.
  - `DELETE /roles/{id}`: Delete a role.
- **Documentation**:
  - Handles CRUD operations for roles.
  - Each role defines a set of permissions that users associated with the role can perform.

### Microservice 3: Department Management Service (Backend Name: department-service)::
- **Responsibility:** Manages department-related operations.
- **Database:** Includes tables such as departments, department_employees, etc., to store department information and employee associations.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /departments`: Retrieve a list of all departments.
  - `GET /departments/{id}`: Retrieve details of a specific department.
  - `POST /departments`: Create a new department.
  - `PUT /departments/{id}`: Update an existing department.
  - `DELETE /departments/{id}`: Delete a department.
- **Documentation**:
  - Handles CRUD operations for departments.
  - Requires proper authentication and authorization to access the endpoints.


### Microservice 4: Module Management Service (Backend Name: module-service)::
- **Responsibility:** Manages different modules of the application.
- **Database:** Includes tables such as departments, department_employees, etc., to store department information and employee associations.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /modules`: Retrieve a list of all modules.
  - `GET /modules/{id}`: Retrieve details of a specific module.
  - `POST /modules`: Create a new module.
  - `PUT /modules/{id}`: Update an existing module.
  - `DELETE /modules/{id}`: Delete a module.
- **Documentation**:
  - Handles CRUD operations for modules like Dashboard, Analytics, Lead Generation, SMS, etc.
  - Modules represent different sections or functionalities of the application.
  - Allows administrators to manage the available modules and their configurations.

### Microservice 5: Role-Permission Service (ACL)

- **Functionality**: Manages access control lists (ACL) based on roles and permissions.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /acl/{role_id}`: Retrieve permissions associated with a specific role.
  - `POST /acl`: Assign permissions to a role.
  - `DELETE /acl/{role_id}/{permission_id}`: Remove a permission from a role.
- **Documentation**:
  - Defines the access control lists for various resources and actions.
